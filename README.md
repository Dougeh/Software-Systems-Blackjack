# Software-Systems-Projects
This's a project I made during a Software Systems Design course that I'm pretty proud of, so I figured I'd post it here!
For the exe, just run it and it'll open a little window with these controls:
- Available $ textbox - Choose your starting capital
- Number of Decks to Use dropbox - the number of decks you'd like to populate the virtual shoe (combined deck) with
- Seed textbox - Choose a random seed to shuffle the cards with
- Hit 17 - Dealer always hits (once) if their hand totals 17+
- Soft 17 - Dealer always stands if their hand totals 17+

Once you hit "Start game," a green window will pop up  and the dealer will start chatting you up.  In the center are two controls:
  - Textbox for entering your bets
  - Seed changer in the corner
    - Textbox for new seed entry
    - Button to set new seed
  - Buttons
    - New bet - places bet, starts drawing cards
    - Hit - Draws a card
    - Stand - Stop taking cards, allowing the dealer to draw their hand
The goal is to have the highest count between your cards' combined numbers.  If you win, you get your bet back x2.  If you get Blackjack (an Ace and a 10 of some kind), you get your bet back x3.

Have fun with it!
